title: Segmenting Cross the Pond   
---
It's been a whirlwind of activity since my last post. I traveled to Canada for 2 weeks for a bridge tournament, went to New York and Charlotte to visit friends
and family, and moved to _England_. That's a bit of a shift! 

I've settled in to Cambridge, England. So far, it's been great. Today I started my course in <a href = 'https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mphil/compbio'>Computational Biology</a>.
Meeting my classmates was really invigorating. 

One new friend in particular is very interested in <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation'> Image Segmentation </a>, 
an increasingly important field of machine learning with huge applications to medicine. I told him all about my experience in image segmentation,
but realized a great blog post by my mentor <a href = 'https://twitter.com/AndrewLBeam'>Andrew Beam, PhD</a> at Harvard was up on my blog yet. 

Check it out <a href='http://beamandrew.github.io/deeplearning/2016/08/20/kaggle-segmentation.html'> *here*</a>!

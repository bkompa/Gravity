title: Hello World and Goodbye College  
---

Hey World, I'm Ben. I've wanted to scribble a blog for a while, so I'm giving it a go. Check out my <a href='https://bkompa.github.io/about/'>About</a> page for more info about who I am. 

This blog will serve as my sketchpad, sandbox, and junkdraw for all thoughts computer science + life. This summer, I plan on reviewing two books from my undergraduate education, which happened to end today. 
1. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494395422&sr=8-1&keywords=machine+learning+a+probabilistic+perspective'>Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</a>
2. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494395590&sr=8-1&keywords=clrs+algorithms'>CLRS Introdution to Algorithms</a>

Here on this blog, I'll upload iPython notebooks to cover the topics in these books. This is a pretty big project, so my gameplan to stay on track is to cover 1 chapter of each book a week. I won't quite finish this summer, but I'll continue during my upcoming year at Cambridge. Wish me luck.

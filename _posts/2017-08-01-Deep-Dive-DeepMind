title: Deep Dive of DeepMind 
---

I'm currently chewing through MLPP Chapter 4 and trying to patch together a post of MLPP Chapter 3, but for starters <a href='https://github.com/bkompa/bkompa.github.io/blob/master/790_kompa_final.pdf'>here</a>
is my final paper for COMP790: Advanced Machine Learning at UNC-CH. I talk about the intersection of machine learning and games. 
Researchers have made great headway in multiple games including Go and Poker.  

A company breaking ground constantly in this field is <a href='deepmind.com'>Deepmind</a>. My paper is essentially a summary of Deepmind's accomplishments
in the past few years with a few outside researchers thrown in. They really are at the forefront of everything this field including <a href='https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/'>AlphaGo</a>.

I'm a graduate of the <a href='http://www.unc.edu/' target="_blank">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, a <a href='http://www.winstonchurchillfoundation.org/index.html' target="_blank"> Churchill Scholar</a>, and a two-time national champion <a href='http://www.acbl.org/learn_page/how-to-play-bridge/' target="_blank">bridge player</a>. 

My interests include bioinformatics, machine learning, statistics, and algorithms. This blog will serve as a deeper dive into ML and algorithms--maybe I'll add more bioinformatics in the future. 

In 2018, I completed be a <a href='https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mphil/compbio' target='_blank'>M.Phil. in Computational Biology</a> at <a href='http://www.cam.ac.uk/' target='_blank'>Cambridge</a>. Post-Cambridge, I joined the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics PhD Program (aka the <a href='http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/big/' target='_blank'>BIG PhD</a>) at Harvard Medical School. 

I'm advised by <a href='https://twitter.com/AndrewLBeam' target='_blank'>Dr. Andrew Beam</a> as part of <a href='https://beamlab.org'>Beam Lab</a>. Follow me on <a href='https://twitter.com/BenKompa' target='_blank'>twitter</a> if you'd like to keep up with my research!
